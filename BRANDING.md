# 🐾 LayerClaw Branding Guide

## Name

**LayerClaw** (one word, CamelCase)

### Pronunciation
"LAY-er-claw" (like "layer" + "claw")

## Tagline

> **Deep Training Observability for PyTorch**  
> Track, debug, and optimize your ML training runs with ease.

## Logo/Icon Concept 🐾

The claw emoji (🐾) represents:
- **Layers** - Neural network layers
- **Claw** - Grabbing/capturing training data
- **Tracks** - Leaving traces/tracks of training runs
- **Precision** - Sharp claws for detailed observation

## Brand Personality

- **Sharp** - Catches issues precisely
- **Lightweight** - Low overhead, fast
- **Friendly** - Easy to use, approachable
- **Powerful** - Deep insights into training

## Usage

### Correct ✅
```
LayerClaw is a training observability tool
Install LayerClaw with: pip install layerclaw
Import with: import tracer
```

### Package Names
- **PyPI**: `layerclaw` (lowercase)
- **Brand**: LayerClaw (CamelCase)
- **Import**: `tracer` (Python module name)

### Example Taglines
- "LayerClaw - Catch Training Issues Before They Bite"
- "LayerClaw - Deep Insights Into Every Layer"
- "LayerClaw - Track Your Training Like a Pro"
- "LayerClaw - Because Training Should Be Observable"

## Color Scheme (Suggested)

- **Primary**: Orange/Amber (#FF6B35) - Warning/attention
- **Secondary**: Deep Blue (#004E89) - Trust/technical
- **Accent**: White (#FFFFFF) - Clean/modern

## Emoji Usage

Use 🐾 (paw prints) throughout:
- README headers
- CLI output
- Error messages: "🐾 LayerClaw caught an anomaly!"
- Success messages: "🐾 Training tracked successfully!"

## Competitor Comparison

| Tool | Focus | LayerClaw Advantage |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| W&B | Team collaboration | Local-first, free, private |
| TensorBoard | Visualization | Gradient focus, CLI-first |
| MLflow | Experiment tracking | Lighter, simpler, specialized |

## Messaging

### For Researchers
"LayerClaw helps you catch gradient explosions, vanishing gradients, and training anomalies before they waste days of compute."

### For Students
"Free, local, and easy - LayerClaw tracks everything about your training runs without any setup."

### For Startups
"Production-grade training observability without the enterprise price tag."
